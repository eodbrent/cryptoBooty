# cryptoBooty
A cryptocurrency Discord bot, expanded from Satoshi Bot

Current supported exchanges: Binance, Bittrex, CoinExchange, CryptoBridge, Cryptopia, Kraken (not anymore, their API is terrible), Kucoin, Nanex, Poloniex, Stocks.Exchange (not anymore, their API is terrible...and stingy), TradeSatoshi and YoBit.

Full README Coming soon

Bot is now hosted.  I'm using it to learn Python, and slowly expanding it.

I merely added exchanges, using the Satoshi wrappers as a template, and goofed around with the main file.
