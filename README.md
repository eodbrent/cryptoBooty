# cryptoBooty
A cryptocurrency Discord bot, expanded from Satoshi Bot

Full README Coming soon

Bot is now hosted.  I'm using it to learn Python, and slowly expanding it.

For the original Satoshi bot, please see:

I merely added exchanges, using the Satoshi wrappers as a template, and goofed around with the main file.
